Spring-Boot-JSF-Example
=======================

Looked around and saw on stack overflow that no one had a working example of JSF and Spring boot working together. So I added this example so that I could use it to answer some stack-overflow questions

To run use 

```
Windows:
gradlew run 

Other:
sh gradlew run
```

After that visit these 2 urls

JSF Example [http://localhost:8080/test.xhtml](http://localhost:8080/test.xhtml)

and 

Spring MVC Greeting Service [http://localhost:8080/greeting](http://localhost:8080/greeting)

There was a common belief that because JSF and Spring MVC were their own view technologies and that they could not be used together, but this is incorrect and is part of this example.
